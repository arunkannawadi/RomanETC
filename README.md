GitHub repository for Roman Space Telescope wide-field Galaxy Survey Exposure Time Calculator (wfGSETC)

This is an unofficial copy of Roman Space Telescope Exposure Time Calculator (ETC)
written by @hirata10 and hosted by NASA at https://roman.ipac.caltech.edu/sims/tools/wfDepc/wfDepc.html.
The original code is intended to be a stand-alone executable.
The code here will be modified to support both application mode as well as
library mode to be used with other software, in C and in Python.
